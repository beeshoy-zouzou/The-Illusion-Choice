# Dialog System — The Illusion Choice

This dialog system for **The Illusion Choice** is built with **Inky** and **Godot** using the inkgd add-on.
It allows you to create story-driven conversations with **linear and branching dialogs** inside Godot.
> This is a **technical prototype** for testing dialog flow.

---

### Features
- Integrates Inky stories into Godot using inkgd  
- Supports both linear and mixed linear/branching dialogs  
- The system can be tested freely in a seperate scene  
- Currently, integration with NPCs is done manually
- Future plan: provide editor tools to integrate the dialog system directly into NPCs.
