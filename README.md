# The Illusion Choice

**The Illusion Choice** is a short story-driven platformer prototype built in **Godot**.  
You play as a curious adventurer drawn into a surreal world where NPCs break the fourth wall, and even the narrator might not be what they seem. Interact with characters like Beeshoy and the elusive Butler to uncover strange truths — but be warned: your choices may matter... or maybe they don’t.

> This is not a full game — it’s a **technical prototype** focused on testing **linear and branching dialog systems** and interaction flow.
